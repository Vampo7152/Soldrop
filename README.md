# Soldrop- User Guide Documentation


## Soldrop is completely Secure way to send Batch Transactions over Solana Ecosystem. Though we use Secret Key method to send Transctions curretly, we are moving ahead and developing the features to do Airdrops just by Connecting your Phantom Wallet and signing Transctions.I assure youregarding the security and reliability of your wallet and its funds, as we never store your data anywhere, not even the transactions and you can clear everything by just clicking a cute refresh Button!        Check out this video guide to learn how to Airdrop the Tokens easily- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QdCkwoU42Jf-XZUBFvVMEmMuTUQp71_n/view?usp=drivesdk

Format Your CSV files- 
The File Structure should have to be in this format where we have the wallet address of the person, a Comma(,) and the amount of Token to be send without any space between them. Youcan even check the whole file here to get a clear idea- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Qp4oQDGBRzlkltsIaLdlor-3R8sw1dNF/view?usp=drivesdk         ![Wallet Structure](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91828247/142858896-4311a737-7c91-4add-aec5-615178336f23.png)

After the File is Formatted Properly along with Wallet addresses and amount of Tokens, we are ready to do the actual stuff!

## Step-1

## Step-3

## Step-4 
Then Select what Token you want to Airdrop, if its a SPL Token, please specify the contract address of that token along with its decimal.
